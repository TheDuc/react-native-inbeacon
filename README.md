# react-native-inbeacon
NOTE: This library is still under development and is not stable yet.

This module is providing a bridge between React Native and the Android / iOS Native SDKs from Inbeacon. It is a third-party module so not created by any of the Inbeacon creators. The module is created because I as creator did need to make use of Inbeacon within React Native. There was no library for it yet, so why not make it myself and publish it?

Contribution to the library is highly appreciated! üëç
